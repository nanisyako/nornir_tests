- Write doc tutorial for all tests and be realistic
- Add custom or plugin type tests
- Add logic to reorganize tests so that any test_until is last
- Keep trying to figure out how to wrap grouped task 0
- Not sure if it will make sense to wrap aggregates but for consistency it would be nice
- Keep working on regexp
- Other tests?
