Write doc tutorial for all tests and be realistic

Add custom or plugin type tests

Fix test_until and add try/except to prevent fails

Add logic to reorganize tests so that any test_until is last

Fix test_lxml pytest errors

Keep trying to figure out how to wrap grouped task 0

Not sure if it will make sense to wrap aggregates but for consistency it would be nice
